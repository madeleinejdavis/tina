# Tina Belcher

> "If you need me, I'll be here on the floor dying."

Tina is a wonderfully weird adolescent. She is transitioning from childhood to adulthood. She loves unicorns, rainbows and butts. She documents these interests in her “Erotic Friend Fiction”. She has a crush on Jimmy Pesto Jr., and anyone else whose posterior she finds attractive, including an entire zombie basketball team. Her interest in and passion for butts comes in handy when she helps save her father’s life through butt identification. For more info on [Tina] (http://bobs-burgers.wikia.com/wiki/Tina_Belcher).
